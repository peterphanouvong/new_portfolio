    <p>My friend and colleague Alex, the head of the digital sub comittee at BITSA came to me to help build the website for their society. When I got access to it, it was just plain HTML and CSS with little functionality. It was difficult to add content and update the site. To help alleviate the problem I did a design overhaul in the front end and the backend, having the site run on django which would allow admin to make changes and add content easily, whilst also making it look a bit prettier.</p>
